# g-holo
 Using P5.js and PoseNet, this program is able to attribute gestures to transformations of a 3D cube in real-time. To run,
 
 - click the link below
 - allow camera access
 - stand about 4 feet from your camera so that the program can judge distance via hand location
 - hold hands with palms facing towards the camera centered in front of you with thumbs ~4inches apart
  - this will distance the object away from you, as if shrinking it
 - to enlarge the object, increase distance between hands
 - to raise object lift hands up above shoulders
 - to lower object, lower hands to hips
 - to rotate object, 
  - raise right arm to shoulders, lower left arm to hips
  - OR lower right argm to hips, raise left arm to shoulders
